                                    <p>On advertising where a debit order is allowed, monthly accounts are due and

                                        further advertising. In this event, the advertiser or agency shall pay for

                                    <p>Extension of credit to advertising agencies is based on the agency’s acceptance
                                        of sole liability for all advertising placed by it and billed to its account. No
                                        endorsement, statement or disclaimer on any insertion order, check or letter
                                        shall act as an accord or satisfaction, or as a waiver of this condition unless
                                        and until it is accepted by The Publisher by a separate written agreement signed
                                        by a duly authorized representative of The Publisher. In the event of nonpayment

                                        and its client(s). No such action on the part of The Publisher shall relieve the

                                    <p>Preprint advertisers are billed based on average circulation within the purchased
                                        advertising zones, as published in The Publisher’s period estimates, which may
                                        vary slightly from the number of inserts distributed on a particular issue. The
                                        Publisher will not be responsible, nor provide billing or rate adjustments, for
                                        shortages resulting from these variances, including variances due to errors in
                                        the insertion or distribution process, shortages in the advertiser’s delivery of
                                        preprints, and inserts that are not within The Post’s insert specifications.</p>

                                        conditions. Terms, conditions, rates or agreements not set forth herein or in
                                        then-current rate schedules are not binding on The Publisher. Customer service
